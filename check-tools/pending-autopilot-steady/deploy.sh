# One-off deploy (built and tested locally on 10 Oct 2026), stockiq-ai-trader and the panel script:
#   - a coin is bought only once it has stayed on the shortlist for two check-ins running (when checking in every 3 hours
#     or less); each buy remembers how long it had stayed and the record is split by it
#   - a coin screener is rested on its own results, not against the S&P 500 fund
#   - the last 30 days are also shown after a typical trading cost (nothing is taken from the fake money)
# What it is and why: .kiro/steering/site-overview.md, section 8c.
#
#   Preview (changes nothing):   DRY_RUN=true bash deploy.sh
#   Deploy:                      bash deploy.sh
#
# Safe to run twice: each step first checks whether it has already been done, and stops if the live
# code or a website file is not what this was built against.
#
# Roll back: the previous Lambda code is saved in ~/VSCODE/backup/stockiq-ai-trader_before_autopilot_steady_20261010.zip
#   aws lambda update-function-code --function-name stockiq-ai-trader --zip-file fileb://<that zip> --profile default --region us-east-1
# Website files: git checkout practice-autopilot.js and dashboard.html in ~/VSCODE/website and upload them again.
# (The older function simply ignores what the newer one added to a user's record.)
