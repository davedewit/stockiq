# One-off deploy (13 Oct 2026): the top of the Practice portfolio tab made simple.
# The owner, from a picture of it: "this is honestly confusing… its just too much". About seventeen figures stood there at
# once, several of them twice. Now: three figures (Account value, Today, Since the start), one line (cash, in holdings,
# ahead of or behind an S&P 500 fund), and "The breakdown" one click away with everything that was there before.
# practice-portfolio.js v=29 and the version number in dashboard.html.

#   Preview (changes nothing):   DRY_RUN=true bash deploy.sh
#   Deploy:                      bash deploy.sh
