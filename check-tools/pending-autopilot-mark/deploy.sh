# One-off deploy (11 Oct 2026): the dashboard's "AI autopilot" tab carries a warning mark while something needs the owner
# ("Needs you" on the autopilot panel), so it is seen from any tab. Website files only (practice-autopilot.js,
# dashboard.html for the script version); no function changes.
#
#   Preview (changes nothing):   DRY_RUN=true bash deploy.sh
#   Deploy:                      bash deploy.sh
#
# Safe to run twice; stops if a website file is not what this was built against.
# Roll back: git checkout practice-autopilot.js and dashboard.html in ~/VSCODE/website and upload them again.
