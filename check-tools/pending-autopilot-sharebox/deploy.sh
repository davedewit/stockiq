# One-off deploy (11 Oct 2026): the "Screeners it buys from" card is laid out more clearly. A coloured bar shows how the
# budget is spread over the markets; each market is a row with its screeners and, on the right, its share of the budget in
# an outlined box of its own (the owner had not noticed the menus); a market with nothing ticked says it has no share.
# Website files only (practice-autopilot.js, dashboard.html for the version).
#
#   Preview (changes nothing):   DRY_RUN=true bash deploy.sh
#   Deploy:                      bash deploy.sh
#
# Safe to run twice; stops if a website file is not what this was built against.
# Roll back: git checkout practice-autopilot.js and dashboard.html in ~/VSCODE/website and upload them again.
