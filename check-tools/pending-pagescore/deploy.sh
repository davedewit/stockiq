# One-off deploy (18 Oct 2026): the 0-100 score of the single-stock report and the stock pages turned round where it bet against the
# trend (check-tools/scoring/page_score_study.py: its top fifth did worse than its bottom fifth in 13 of 18 half-periods; turned
# round it beat the old score in 15 of 18). The daily review's proposal 2. stock_metrics.py (the pages' copy) is in git and is
# used by the next daily run; the About page's line on the score.
#   Preview: DRY_RUN=true bash deploy.sh    Deploy: bash deploy.sh
# Roll back: ~/VSCODE/backup/stockiq-option-1-1-custom-analysis_before_pagescore_20261018.zip; stock_metrics.py and about.html from git.
