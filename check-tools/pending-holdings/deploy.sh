# One-off deploy (19 Oct 2026): the autopilot's holdings listed once, on the Practice portfolio tab, with their tags (closed market,
# stop, patient share) and a "Can be sold now" choice; "Holding now" on the autopilot tab becomes a line pointing there; a holding's
# plan no longer says the AI model reviews it (off since 17 Oct). The AI chat's guide follows (and knows the stop watch and the budget
# that follows results). practice-portfolio.js, practice-autopilot.js, dashboard.html; stockiq-ai-chat.
#   Preview: DRY_RUN=true bash deploy.sh    Deploy: bash deploy.sh
# Roll back: ~/VSCODE/backup/stockiq-ai-chat_before_holdings_20261019.zip; the website files from git.
