# One-off deploy (12 Oct 2026): an empty settings box says "Automatic: 5", not a bare 5.
# The owner: "when i type nothing in there its saying 5 shouldn't it say Automatic: 5". The two boxes that can be left to
# the risk level ("Build up to it over", "Number of holdings") showed the level's value as a bare greyed number, which
# read like a value typed in; the two menus beside them already said "Automatic: every 6 hours". Typing a number replaces
# it, as before. A few lines of practice-autopilot.js (v=42) and the version number in dashboard.html.
#
#   Preview (changes nothing):   DRY_RUN=true bash deploy.sh
#   Deploy:                      bash deploy.sh
#
# Safe to run twice. Stops if a live file is not what this was built from. Roll back: the website files from git.
